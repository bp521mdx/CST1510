"""
 Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Uses:** functions, `return`, `random.randint()`

At the top of your file, write `import random`.
 Define a function called `get_computer_choice()`.
 Inside it, create a variable `number` and set it to `random.randint(0, 2)`.
 Use `if`/`elif`/`else` to check `number`:
- if it is `0`, return `"rock"`
- if it is `1`, return `"paper"`
- otherwise, return `"scissors"`
 Define a function called `decide_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)`.
 Inside it, if `user_choice` equals `computer_choice`, return `"draw"`.
 Add an `elif` that returns `"user"` if the user wins
   (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper).
 Add an `else` that returns `"computer"`.
 Outside the functions, use `input()` to ask the user for their choice
   and store it in a variable called `user_choice`.
 Call `get_computer_choice()` and store the result in `computer_choice`.
 Print the computer's choice.
 Call `decide_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)` and store the result
 in `winner`.
 Print who won.
